%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
We present QuDiffuse, a novel image generation model that combines hierarchical binary latent diffusion with quantum annealing-based sampling. Our approach leverages a multi-level hierarchical architecture with binary latent representations to efficiently represent complex image distributions, while utilizing quantum-inspired sampling techniques to overcome the exponential complexity of exploring high-dimensional binary spaces. The key innovation of QuDiffuse is the integration of Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)~\cite{hinton2006fast, hinton2009dbn} within a diffusion process to enable denoising in a discrete binary latent space, with optional quantum acceleration that significantly improves sample quality and diversity. Our model employs a hierarchical encoder-decoder structure with multi-scale binary representations, a specialized binary diffusion process, and a quantum annealing-based sampling mechanism that can operate in multi-anneal mode for enhanced exploration. This architecture enables efficient generation of high-quality images while potentially reducing the computational burden of traditional diffusion models by operating in a compressed binary space with fewer denoising steps.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Diffusion models have emerged as one of the most successful approaches for high-quality image generation, demonstrating exceptional performance across numerous domains \cite{ddpm, ddim, latent}. However, existing diffusion models face significant challenges: they typically require hundreds of denoising steps for high-quality generation, operate in continuous high-dimensional spaces that demand substantial computational resources, and often struggle with the exponential complexity of modeling high-dimensional distributions.

Binary latent representations offer several potential advantages for generative modeling, including more compact representation, reduced computational complexity, and direct connection to quantum optimization techniques~\cite{courbariaux2016binarized}. Previous work on binary latent spaces has shown promise for efficient generative modeling \cite{vqvae, vqgan, vae}, but combining binary representations with diffusion processes introduces unique challenges, particularly in navigating the discrete nature of the latent space during the denoising process.

In this paper, we introduce QuDiffuse, a state-of-the-art image generation framework that addresses these challenges by combining adaptive hierarchical binary latent diffusion with quantum annealing-based sampling~\cite{kadowaki1998quantum}. Our approach features four key innovations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item An adaptive hierarchical binary latent space that efficiently encodes images with learned multi-scale representations and cross-level dependencies, enabling compact yet expressive representation with optimal bit allocation.
    \item A cross-level conditional binary diffusion process operating on Bernoulli distributions, with level-specific adaptive noise scheduling that captures inter-level dependencies during both forward and reverse processes.
    \item A quantum annealing-based sampling mechanism~\cite{kirkpatrick1983optimization, kadowaki1998quantum} that efficiently explores the binary latent space, with an advanced multi-anneal protocol that progressively refines samples for improved quality.
    \item An attention-augmented hierarchical architecture that dynamically allocates representational capacity based on image content complexity, achieving superior reconstruction quality with fewer bits.
\end{enumerate}

The integration of these components yields a model that can generate high-quality images with substantially fewer denoising steps than traditional diffusion models, while potentially leveraging quantum acceleration for enhanced sampling efficiency. 

Our main contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An adaptive hierarchical binary latent diffusion framework with learned structure that enables efficient representation and generation of complex images.
    \item A cross-level conditional binary diffusion process with level-specific noise scheduling and adaptive gradient-based denoising for discrete spaces.
    \item A content-aware bit allocation strategy that dynamically assigns representational capacity based on region complexity.
    \item A quantum annealing-based sampling approach that enhances exploration of binary latent spaces, with a novel multi-anneal refinement strategy.
    \item The integration of Deep Belief Networks~\cite{hinton2006fast, hinton2009dbn} as robust denoisers for binary latent diffusion, augmented with cross-level attention mechanisms.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews related work in diffusion models, binary representations, and quantum machine learning. Section 3 presents our QuDiffuse methodology, detailing the adaptive hierarchical binary architecture, cross-level conditional diffusion process, and quantum sampling approach. Section 4 describes our experimental setup, while Section 5 discusses results and implications. We conclude in Section 6 with limitations and future directions.

\section{Related Work}
\label{related}

\subsection{Diffusion Models}
Diffusion Probabilistic Models \cite{diffusion, ddpm} have established themselves as powerful generative frameworks that progressively transform noise into structured data through an iterative denoising process. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) \cite{ddpm} formulated the connection between diffusion and score-based generative models, enabling high-quality image generation. Subsequent works have improved sampling efficiency through techniques like DDIM \cite{ddim} and adaptive step size selection. Latent Diffusion Models \cite{latent} reduced computational requirements by operating in a compressed latent space rather than pixel space, while maintaining generation quality.

\subsection{Binary Latent Representations}
Binary latent representations have been explored in various contexts due to their compactness and computational advantages. Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) \cite{vqvae} introduced discrete latent spaces using a learned codebook approach, while subsequent work explored binary activations with straight-through gradient estimation \cite{bengio2013estimating, bengio2013propagating} to enable end-to-end training despite the non-differentiable binary operation. Binary neural networks \cite{binarized, courbariaux2016binarized} demonstrated that models can maintain reasonable performance even with extreme quantization, replacing traditional floating-point operations with logical XNOR and POPCOUNT operations for significantly reduced memory footprint and power consumption. More recently, works like \cite{structured, unleashing} have explored discrete diffusion processes for text and image generation, though typically not in a fully binary latent space.

\subsection{Quantum Machine Learning}
Quantum machine learning represents an emerging frontier that leverages quantum computing principles to potentially accelerate or enhance classical machine learning tasks. Quantum annealing \cite{quantum_annealing, kadowaki1998quantum} offers a specialized approach for solving binary optimization problems, with D-Wave's quantum annealers demonstrating capability in sampling from complex distributions. The quantum annealing process was first formulated in its present form by Kadowaki and Nishimori \cite{kadowaki1998quantum} and has been shown to outperform classical simulated annealing \cite{kirkpatrick1983optimization} in certain problem landscapes, particularly when the energy barriers are high but thin. Recent work has explored using quantum annealing for training Boltzmann machines \cite{qbm, amin2018quantum} and accelerating sampling from complex posterior distributions \cite{quantum_sampling}. D-Wave's recent systems, with thousands of qubits, have claimed quantum computational supremacy for useful real-world problems \cite{dwave2025beyond}, though they remain limited to optimization problems formulated as Ising models or QUBOs. Quantum-inspired classical algorithms, such as simulated quantum annealing, provide many of the advantages of quantum approaches while running on classical hardware.

\subsection{Hierarchical Representations}
Hierarchical representations have proven valuable across numerous generative models. Progressive GANs \cite{pggan} demonstrated the benefits of multi-scale generation for high-resolution images. VQ-VAE-2 \cite{vqvae2} employed a hierarchical discrete latent structure for improved modeling capability. In diffusion models, hierarchical approaches have been used to accelerate the generation process \cite{hierarchical_diffusion} and improve conditioning \cite{imagen}, showing that multi-scale modeling significantly enhances both quality and efficiency.

\subsection{Deep Belief Networks and RBMs}
Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) are generative graphical models composed of multiple layers of stochastic latent variables, with connections between layers but not within layers \cite{hinton2006fast, hinton2009dbn}. They can be trained greedily, one layer at a time, using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) as building blocks. This greedy layer-wise pre-training was one of the first effective deep learning algorithms, addressing optimization challenges during a period when end-to-end backpropagation faced issues like vanishing gradients \cite{hinton2006fast}. 

RBMs are typically trained using the Contrastive Divergence (CD) algorithm \cite{hinton2002training}, which approximates the gradient of the log-likelihood by running a limited number of Gibbs sampling steps. CD-k (where k represents the number of Gibbs sampling steps, typically k=1) performs surprisingly well in practice despite being an approximation to the true maximum likelihood gradient. This pragmatic approach to algorithm design, prioritizing tractability and empirical performance, was crucial for making RBMs and subsequently DBNs viable models.

\section{QuDiffuse Methodology}
\label{sec:method}

\subsection{Overview}
QuDiffuse combines three key components: (1) a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture that transforms images into multi-level binary latent representations and back, (2) a specialized binary diffusion process with DBN-based denoising, and (3) quantum annealing-based sampling for enhanced latent space exploration. Figure \ref{fig:overview} illustrates the overall architecture.

\subsection{Binary Latent Representation}
\label{sec:binary_latent}

We begin by constructing an adaptive hierarchical binary latent space that efficiently encodes image content at multiple scales with dynamic bit allocation. Given an input image $\img \in \R^{C \times H \times W}$, our goal is to transform it into a set of binary latent representations $\{\binary^1, \binary^2, ..., \binary^L\}$ where $\binary^l \in \{0,1\}^{C_l \times H_l \times W_l}$ represents the binary features at level $l$ of the hierarchy, with the number of levels $L$ and per-level dimensions determined adaptively through the learning process.

\subsubsection{Adaptive Hierarchical Encoder}
The adaptive hierarchical encoder $\encoder$ consists of a dynamically learned hierarchy of levels, each operating at a different spatial resolution to capture features at multiple scales. We implement a learnable hierarchical structure by introducing gating mechanisms that determine the optimal number of levels and their respective dimensions based on the input data distribution. 

Formally, for each level $l \in \{1,2,...,L_{\text{max}}\}$, we define the following transformation:

\begin{equation}
\latent^l = \mathcal{E}^l(\img, \{\latent^k\}_{k<l}) = \sigma(\mathcal{F}^l_{\theta}(\mathcal{D}^l(\img), \mathcal{A}^l(\{\latent^k\}_{k<l})))
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{D}^l(\cdot)$ is an adaptive downsampling operation that reduces spatial resolution by a learned factor $s_l$
    \item $\mathcal{F}^l_{\theta}(\cdot)$ is a feature extraction function composed of residual blocks and attention mechanisms
    \item $\mathcal{A}^l(\cdot)$ is a cross-level attention mechanism that conditions the current level on all coarser levels
    \item $\sigma(\cdot)$ is the sigmoid activation function that normalizes outputs to $[0,1]$
\end{itemize}

The addition of cross-level conditioning through $\mathcal{A}^l$ allows each level to leverage information from coarser levels, enabling more efficient representation by avoiding redundancy across levels and capturing dependencies that would otherwise be lost in a strictly independent hierarchical structure.

Each level's feature extraction module $\mathcal{F}^l_{\theta}$ consists of a sequence of residual blocks with adaptive channel dimensions:

\begin{equation}
\text{ResBlock}(x) = x + \mathcal{G}(\mathcal{G}(x)) \odot \alpha(x)
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{G}$ represents a sequence of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation, and $\alpha(x)$ is a learned gating mechanism that dynamically adjusts the influence of each residual block based on input content complexity. At each level, we incorporate self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies:

\begin{equation}
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V \odot \beta(Q)
\end{equation}

with query, key, and value matrices derived from input features, and $\beta(Q)$ representing a content-dependent attention scaling factor that allocates more attention capacity to complex regions of the input.

\subsubsection{Content-Aware Bit Allocation}
A key innovation in our approach is the dynamic allocation of binary representational capacity based on content complexity. Rather than assigning a fixed number of bits to each spatial location and level, we implement a content-aware bit allocation strategy that assigns more bits to complex regions requiring detailed representation.

For each level $l$, we compute a complexity map $\mathcal{C}^l \in \R^{H_l \times W_l}$ that estimates the local complexity of image content:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{C}^l = \text{Complexity}(\mathcal{F}^l_{\theta}(\mathcal{D}^l(\img)))
\end{equation}

where the Complexity function analyzes feature activations and gradient magnitudes to estimate representational needs. We then use this complexity map to modulate the effective channel depth through a spatially-varying bit allocation matrix $\mathcal{M}^l \in \R^{C_l \times H_l \times W_l}$:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M}^l_{i,j,k} = \sigma(w^l_i \cdot \mathcal{C}^l_{j,k} + b^l_i)
\end{equation}

where $w^l_i$ and $b^l_i$ are learned parameters. This matrix is used to modulate the continuous latent representations:

\begin{equation}
\tilde{\latent}^l = \latent^l \odot \mathcal{M}^l
\end{equation}

This content-aware modulation ensures that more bits are effectively allocated to complex regions, while simpler regions use fewer bits, resulting in a more efficient representation overall.

The continuous latent variables $\tilde{\latent}^l$ are then converted to binary representations through a stochastic binarization process:

\begin{equation}
\binary^l = \text{STBinarize}(\tilde{\latent}^l, \tau)
\end{equation}

where $\text{STBinarize}$ is our straight-through binarization function with temperature parameter $\tau$. During the forward pass, this function performs hard thresholding:

\begin{equation}
\text{STBinarize}_{\text{forward}}(\latent, \tau) = \mathbbm{1}_{\latent > 0.5}
\end{equation}

During the backward pass, we implement a temperature-controlled gradient estimator that scales gradients based on proximity to the decision boundary:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \text{STBinarize}}{\partial \latent} = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{\gamma}{\tau} \cdot (1 - |\latent - 0.5| \cdot 2) & \text{if } |\latent - 0.5| < 0.2 \\
1.0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $\gamma$ is a scaling factor (typically 1.2) and $\tau$ is the temperature parameter that controls the sharpness of gradient scaling. This temperature is annealed during training from an initial value $\tau_0 = 1.0$ to a final value $\tau_{\text{min}} = 0.5$ according to:

\begin{equation}
\tau_{t+1} = \max(\tau_{\text{min}}, \tau_t \cdot \alpha)
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is the annealing rate (typically 0.9999). This annealing process gradually transitions from exploration (higher temperature) to exploitation (lower temperature) during training.

This approach builds upon the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) proposed by Bengio et al.~\cite{bengio2013estimating, bengio2013propagating}, which enables backpropagation through non-differentiable operations. Beyond simply approximating gradients, stochastic binary neurons offer advantages including more biologically plausible sparse representations (which serve as a form of regularization) and sparse gradients that can reduce optimization difficulty due to ill-conditioning~\cite{bengio2013estimating}. Our temperature-controlled gradient scaling enhances the standard STE by providing finer control over the training dynamics.

\subsubsection{Cross-Level Attention-Augmented Hierarchical Decoder}
The hierarchical decoder $\decoder$ mirrors the encoder structure but reverses the operations to reconstruct the original image, incorporating cross-level attention mechanisms to facilitate information flow between levels. Given binary latent representations $\{\binary^1, \binary^2, ..., \binary^L\}$, the decoder progressively transforms them into an output image $\recon$:

\begin{equation}
\recon = \decoder(\binary^1, \binary^2, ..., \binary^L)
\end{equation}

For each level $l$, the decoder includes bidirectional cross-level attention:

\begin{equation}
\hat{\img}^l = \mathcal{D}^l(\binary^l, \mathcal{X}^l(\{\hat{\img}^{k}\}_{k>l}, \{\binary^{j}\}_{j<l}))
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{D}^l$ represents the decoder function for level $l$, and $\mathcal{X}^l$ is a cross-level attention mechanism that conditions the current level's decoding on both:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The partially decoded outputs from finer levels ($\{\hat{\img}^{k}\}_{k>l}$)
    \item The binary representations from coarser levels ($\{\binary^{j}\}_{j<l}$)
\end{itemize}

This bidirectional information flow enables more effective reconstruction by allowing each level to leverage information from both coarser and finer scales. The cross-level attention mechanism is defined as:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{X}^l(F, C) = \text{MultiHeadAttention}(Q=\mathcal{T}^l(\binary^l), K=\mathcal{K}(F, C), V=\mathcal{V}(F, C))
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{T}^l$, $\mathcal{K}$, and $\mathcal{V}$ are learned transformations that project the binary representation and cross-level information into query, key, and value spaces respectively.

The decoder's final output passes through a refinement stage to enhance visual quality:

\begin{equation}
\recon = \mathcal{T}(\hat{\img}^1)
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{T}$ is a final transformation that ensures the output matches the desired image distribution, typically implemented as a series of convolutional layers followed by a hyperbolic tangent activation to bound values in the range $[-1, 1]$.

This adaptive hierarchical structure with cross-level dependencies and content-aware bit allocation allows the model to capture both fine details and global structure more efficiently, with each level operating at a different abstraction scale tailored to the specific characteristics of the input data distribution. The dynamic bit allocation ensures representational capacity is distributed optimally, reducing redundancy and focusing resources where they are most needed.

\subsection{Binary Diffusion Process}
\label{sec:binary_diffusion}

Our diffusion process operates in the adaptive hierarchical binary latent space, modeling the gradual transformation of structured binary codes to random noise and back. Unlike Gaussian diffusion models that operate in continuous spaces, our approach introduces a specialized cross-level conditional Bernoulli diffusion process designed specifically for binary-valued variables with inter-level dependencies.

\subsubsection{Level-Specific Adaptive Forward Diffusion}
Let $\binary^0 = \{\binary^{0,1}, \binary^{0,2}, ..., \binary^{0,L}\}$ represent the initial binary latent representation across all $L$ levels produced by the encoder. The forward diffusion process gradually transforms these structured binary patterns into random noise through a Markov chain that progressively increases randomness, with each level having its own optimized noise schedule.

For each level $l$, we define the forward process with cross-level dependencies:

\begin{equation}
q(\binary_l^{1:T}|\binary_l^0, \{\binary_j^{0:T}\}_{j<l}) = \prod_{t=1}^{T} q(\binary_l^t|\binary_l^{t-1}, \{\binary_j^{t-1}\}_{j<l})
\end{equation}

This formulation explicitly models dependencies between levels during the forward process, where the transition for level $l$ is conditioned not only on its previous state but also on the states of all coarser levels.

Each cross-level conditional transition follows:

\begin{equation}
q(\binary_l^t|\binary_l^{t-1}, \{\binary_j^{t-1}\}_{j<l}) = \Bernoulli(\binary_l^t; (1-\beta_l(t))\binary_l^{t-1} + \gamma_l(\{\binary_j^{t-1}\}_{j<l}, t))
\end{equation}

where $\beta_l(t) \in [0,1]$ is a level-specific noise schedule that can be adaptive to both the level and current timestep, and $\gamma_l(\cdot)$ is a learned function that models the influence of coarser levels on the current level's noise process, defined as:

\begin{equation}
\gamma_l(\{\binary_j^{t-1}\}_{j<l}, t) = \mathcal{H}_l(\{\binary_j^{t-1}\}_{j<l}, t) \cdot 0.5\beta_l(t)
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{H}_l$ is implemented as a level-specific neural network that maps the coarser levels' states to a modulation factor for the current level's noise process.

For each level, we implement an adaptive noise scheduling strategy that automatically determines the optimal noise schedule based on the level's characteristics and its position in the hierarchy:

\begin{equation}
\beta_l(t) = \mathcal{S}_l(t/T, \mathcal{P}_l)
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{S}_l$ is a scheduling function parametrized by learnable parameters $\mathcal{P}_l$ specific to level $l$. This allows finer levels to potentially use different noise schedules than coarser levels, which tend to benefit from different noise dynamics. The scheduling function can take several forms:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Adaptive cosine schedule}: $\alpha_l(t) = \cos\left(\frac{t/T \cdot \pi/2 + \delta_l}{1 + \delta_l}\right)^2$ with learnable offset $\delta_l$
    \item \textbf{Sigmoid-based schedule}: $\beta_l(t) = \beta_{\text{min},l} + (\beta_{\text{max},l} - \beta_{\text{min},l}) \cdot \sigma(w_l \cdot t/T + b_l)$ with learnable parameters $w_l$ and $b_l$
    \item \textbf{Spline-based schedule}: Using a differentiable spline with learnable control points to define a flexible noise schedule
\end{enumerate}

This adaptive, level-specific approach allows the model to learn optimal noise dynamics for each level, with coarser levels typically benefiting from slower noise schedules to preserve global structure, while finer levels can accommodate faster noising for local details.

Through the cross-level dependency function $\mathcal{H}_l$, we enable information exchange during the forward process. For example, if a coarse level's bits representing global structure are still relatively intact (low noise), the noise process for corresponding regions in finer levels may be slowed to preserve detail in those structurally important areas.

Similar to standard diffusion models, our forward process has a useful property enabling direct sampling at arbitrary timesteps:

\begin{equation}
q(\binary_l^t|\binary_l^0, \{\binary_j^{0}\}_{j<l}) = \Bernoulli(\binary_l^t; \alpha_l(t)\binary_l^0 + (1-\alpha_l(t))(\mathcal{H}_l(\{\binary_j^{0}\}_{j<l}, t) \cdot 0.5))
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_l(t) = \prod_{i=1}^{t}(1-\beta_l(i))$ represents the cumulative noise level for level $l$. This property is crucial for efficient training, as we can randomly sample timesteps and noise levels for each level rather than simulating the entire diffusion process.

\subsubsection{Cross-Level Conditional Reverse Diffusion with DBN Denoising}
The reverse diffusion process systematically removes noise from random binary patterns to generate structured representations, with each level's denoising process conditioned on coarser levels. Given a sample $\binary^T \sim \Bernoulli(0.5)$ from a random distribution for each level, our goal is to transform it into a sample from the data distribution $\binary^0$.

We model the reverse process as a sequence of denoising steps with cross-level conditioning:

\begin{equation}
p_\theta(\binary^{0:T}) = p(\binary^T) \prod_{t=1}^{T} \prod_{l=1}^{L} p_\theta(\binary_l^{t-1}|\binary_l^t, \{\binary_j^{t-1}\}_{j<l}, \{\binary_j^{t}\}_{j<l})
\end{equation}

where each conditional distribution $p_\theta(\binary_l^{t-1}|\binary_l^t, \{\binary_j^{t-1}\}_{j<l}, \{\binary_j^{t}\}_{j<l})$ is parameterized by a Cross-Level Deep Belief Network (CL-DBN) that predicts the denoised state for level $l$ conditioned on both its current noisy state and the states of coarser levels.

\paragraph{Cross-Level DBN Architecture and Training}
Each timestep $t$ and level $l$ employs a specialized CL-DBN designed to model the energy landscape of the binary latent space with cross-level dependencies. A CL-DBN consists of visible units corresponding to the binary variables $\binary_l^t$, hidden units $\bm{h}_l$ that capture patterns and dependencies, and conditional connections from coarser levels.

The energy function of the CL-DBN is defined as:

\begin{equation}
E_\theta(\binary_l, \bm{h}_l, \{\binary_j\}_{j<l}) = -\sum_i a_i \binary_{l,i} - \sum_j b_j h_{l,j} - \sum_{i,j} W_{ij} \binary_{l,i} h_{l,j} - \sum_{i,j,k<l} V_{ijk} \binary_{l,i} h_{l,j} \binary_{k}
\end{equation}

where $a_i$ are visible biases, $b_j$ are hidden biases, $W_{ij}$ are weights connecting visible and hidden units within the level, and $V_{ijk}$ are cross-level weights that connect binary variables from coarser levels to the energy terms of the current level. This energy function defines a conditional probability distribution:

\begin{equation}
p_\theta(\binary_l, \bm{h}_l | \{\binary_j\}_{j<l}) = \frac{1}{Z_\theta(\{\binary_j\}_{j<l})} e^{-E_\theta(\binary_l, \bm{h}_l, \{\binary_j\}_{j<l})}
\end{equation}

with level-specific partition function $Z_\theta(\{\binary_j\}_{j<l}) = \sum_{\binary_l, \bm{h}_l} e^{-E_\theta(\binary_l, \bm{h}_l, \{\binary_j\}_{j<l})}$.

Our adaptive hierarchical architecture automatically determines the optimal dimensions for each level's CL-DBN. The CL-DBN for level $l$ at timestep $t$ has visible units matching $\binary_l^t$ and hidden units with a dynamic ratio determined during training:

\begin{equation}
\text{hidden\_dim}_l = \text{ceiling}(\text{visible\_dim}_l \cdot \text{hidden\_dim\_factor}_l)
\end{equation}

where $\text{hidden\_dim\_factor}_l$ is a learnable parameter.

During training, each CL-DBN learns to predict the true $\binary_l^{t-1}$ given $\binary_l^t$ and $\{\binary_j^{t-1}\}_{j<l}$ through a modified contrastive divergence with $k$ steps (CL-CD-$k$)~\cite{hinton2002training}. The update rules for the CL-DBN parameters are:

\begin{align}
\Delta W_{ij} &= \eta \cdot (\langle \binary_{l,i} h_{l,j} \rangle_{\text{data}} - \langle \binary_{l,i} h_{l,j} \rangle_{\text{model}}) \\
\Delta a_i &= \eta \cdot (\langle \binary_{l,i} \rangle_{\text{data}} - \langle \binary_{l,i} \rangle_{\text{model}}) \\
\Delta b_j &= \eta \cdot (\langle h_{l,j} \rangle_{\text{data}} - \langle h_{l,j} \rangle_{\text{model}}) \\
\Delta V_{ijk} &= \eta \cdot (\langle \binary_{l,i} h_{l,j} \binary_{k} \rangle_{\text{data}} - \langle \binary_{l,i} h_{l,j} \binary_{k} \rangle_{\text{model}})
\end{align}

where $\eta$ is the learning rate, $\langle \cdot \rangle_{\text{data}}$ denotes expectation with respect to the data distribution, and $\langle \cdot \rangle_{\text{model}}$ denotes expectation with respect to the model distribution after $k$ steps of conditional Gibbs sampling.

In practice, we use CL-CD-1 (a single step of conditional Gibbs sampling) which performs surprisingly well despite being an approximation to the true gradient~\cite{hinton2002training}. This approach is computationally efficient while still allowing the model to learn meaningful patterns and cross-level dependencies.

The probability of a visible unit being activated given hidden units and coarser levels is:

\begin{equation}
p_\theta(\binary_{l,i} = 1 | \bm{h}_l, \{\binary_j\}_{j<l}) = \sigma \left( a_i + \sum_j W_{ij} h_{l,j} + \sum_{j,k<l} V_{ijk} h_{l,j} \binary_{k} \right)
\end{equation}

and the probability of a hidden unit being activated given visible units and coarser levels is:

\begin{equation}
p_\theta(h_{l,j} = 1 | \binary_l, \{\binary_j\}_{j<l}) = \sigma \left( b_j + \sum_i W_{ij} \binary_{l,i} + \sum_{i,k<l} V_{ijk} \binary_{l,i} \binary_{k} \right)
\end{equation}

where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function. This cross-level conditioning allows each level's denoising process to leverage information from coarser levels, improving denoising performance by providing global structural guidance to finer-level details.

\subsection{Quantum-Assisted Sampling}
\label{sec:quantum_sampling}

A critical innovation in QuDiffuse is the quantum-assisted sampling approach for efficient exploration of the binary latent space. The binary nature of our latent representation makes it naturally suited to quantum annealing techniques, which excel at solving optimization problems in high-dimensional binary spaces.

\subsubsection{Quantum Annealing for Binary Optimization}
Quantum annealing leverages quantum physics principles to efficiently sample from complex probability distributions defined over binary variables. In our context, we formulate the problem of sampling from the DBN distribution as finding low-energy configurations in the energy landscape.

For a DBN with energy function $E_\theta(\binary, \bm{h})$, the probability of a particular binary configuration is proportional to $\exp(-E_\theta(\binary, \bm{h}))$. Directly sampling from this distribution is challenging due to the exponential number of possible binary configurations. Quantum annealing provides an efficient approach by mapping the energy function to a quantum Hamiltonian and exploiting quantum tunneling to efficiently navigate the energy landscape.

The energy function of our DBN can be reformulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem:

\begin{equation}
E(\bm{s}) = \sum_i q_i s_i + \sum_{i<j} J_{ij} s_i s_j
\end{equation}

where $\bm{s} \in \{0,1\}^n$ represents all binary variables (both visible and hidden units concatenated), $q_i$ are linear coefficients derived from biases, and $J_{ij}$ are quadratic coefficients derived from weights.

The conversion from DBN parameters to QUBO formulation follows these mapping rules:

\begin{align}
q_i &= 
\begin{cases}
-a_i & \text{if $i$ corresponds to a visible unit} \\
-b_{i-n_v} & \text{if $i$ corresponds to a hidden unit}
\end{cases} \\
J_{ij} &= 
\begin{cases}
-W_{ij'} & \text{if $i$ is visible and $j$ is hidden with $j' = j - n_v$} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align}

where $n_v$ is the number of visible units and $W_{ij}$ are the weights connecting visible unit $i$ to hidden unit $j$.

Quantum annealing offers significant performance advantages over classical simulated annealing, especially where the potential energy landscape consists of very high but thin barriers surrounding shallow local minima~\cite{kadowaki1998quantum, kirkpatrick1983optimization}. Unlike classical annealing, which must climb over energy barriers, quantum annealing can tunnel through them, allowing more efficient exploration of rugged energy landscapes~\cite{dwave2025beyond}.

\subsubsection{D-Wave Neal's Simulated Quantum Annealing}
Our implementation uses D-Wave Neal's simulated quantum annealing (SQA), which provides a classical simulation of quantum annealing processes. SQA follows this process:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize the system with a random binary configuration
    \item Simulate the quantum annealing process through Monte Carlo updates:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Start with high "temperature" (quantum fluctuations) that allows the system to explore widely
        \item Gradually reduce temperature according to an annealing schedule
        \item Perform Metropolis updates based on the energy function
    \end{itemize}
    \item Output the final low-energy configuration
\end{enumerate}

The key parameters controlling our SQA implementation include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{num\_reads}: Number of independent annealing runs (default: 100)
    \item \textbf{num\_sweeps}: Number of Monte Carlo sweeps per annealing run (default: 1000)
    \item \textbf{beta\_range}: Temperature range from initial (high temperature) to final (low temperature) values
    \item \textbf{num\_betas}: Number of temperature points in the annealing schedule
\end{itemize}

While our current implementation uses simulated quantum annealing on classical hardware, it is designed to be compatible with physical quantum annealing hardware like D-Wave's quantum processors. D-Wave's recent systems feature over 5,000 qubits in their Advantage2 prototype quantum annealer~\cite{dwave2025beyond} and have demonstrated quantum computational supremacy on useful, real-world problems like magnetic materials simulation, reportedly achieving speedups of three to four orders of magnitude faster than classical supercomputers~\cite{dwave2025beyond}. However, it's important to note that these systems are limited to solving optimization problems formulated as Ising models or QUBOs, making them naturally suited to our binary latent space optimization problem.

\subsubsection{Multi-Anneal Sampling Protocol}
\label{sec:multi_anneal}

To enhance exploration efficiency, we introduce a novel multi-anneal protocol that progressively refines samples through multiple annealing runs with selection. This approach is particularly effective for complex binary distributions that conventional sampling methods struggle to explore efficiently.

The multi-anneal protocol follows this algorithm:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Multi-Anneal Quantum Sampling}
\label{alg:multi_anneal}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE DBN model, anneals\_per\_run, top\_k\_percent, max\_batch\_size
\STATE Initialize quantum sampler with optimal parameters
\STATE // First annealing round
\STATE $\text{samples} \gets \text{QuantumSample(DBN, num\_samples=anneals\_per\_run)}$
\STATE $\text{energies} \gets \text{ComputeEnergies(DBN, samples)}$
\STATE // Multiple refinement rounds
\FOR{$i = 1$ to $\text{max\_batch\_size}$}
    \STATE // Select top-k\% lowest energy samples
    \STATE $\text{threshold} \gets \text{Percentile(energies, top\_k\_percent)}$
    \STATE $\text{selected\_idx} \gets \text{Where(energies} \leq \text{threshold)}$
    \STATE $\text{selected\_samples} \gets \text{samples[selected\_idx]}$
    \STATE // Use these as initial states for next round
    \STATE $\text{new\_samples} \gets \text{QuantumSample(DBN, initial\_states=selected\_samples)}$
    \STATE $\text{new\_energies} \gets \text{ComputeEnergies(DBN, new\_samples)}$
    \STATE // Update current best samples
    \STATE $\text{samples} \gets \text{new\_samples}$
    \STATE $\text{energies} \gets \text{new\_energies}$
\ENDFOR
\RETURN samples
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

This approach offers several advantages:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Progressive refinement}: Each annealing round focuses computational resources on the most promising regions of the latent space
    \item \textbf{Diversity preservation}: By selecting a percentage rather than a fixed number, we maintain sample diversity
    \item \textbf{Adaptive sampling}: The process automatically adapts to the complexity of the energy landscape
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Quantum vs. Classical Sampling}

The quantum-assisted sampling approach offers several theoretical advantages over classical sampling methods:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Quantum tunneling}: Ability to traverse energy barriers that would trap classical MCMC methods. Unlike classical simulated annealing which must climb over energy barriers, quantum annealing can tunnel through them, showing greater resilience to ruggedness in the energy landscape~\cite{kirkpatrick1983optimization, kadowaki1998quantum}.
    \item \textbf{Parallel exploration}: Simultaneous exploration of multiple promising regions of the latent space through quantum superposition.
    \item \textbf{Efficient handling of complex interactions}: Better performance on problems with many interacting variables, which is particularly relevant for our binary latent diffusion where variables can be highly interdependent.
\end{enumerate}

These advantages are particularly relevant for binary latent diffusion, where the relationship between binary variables can be highly complex and interdependent. Even with simulated quantum annealing on classical hardware, we observe improved exploration of the latent space, leading to greater sample diversity and quality.

\subsubsection{Integration with Diffusion Process}

The quantum sampling mechanism is integrated into the diffusion process at two key points:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{During CL-DBN training}: Quantum sampling improves the estimation of the model distribution $\langle \cdot \rangle_{\text{model}}$ in cross-level contrastive divergence, providing better gradient estimates, especially for complex cross-level dependencies.
    
    \item \textbf{During inference}: At each denoising step, instead of simple ancestral sampling from $p_\theta(\binary_l^{t-1}|\binary_l^t, \{\binary_j^{t-1}\}_{j<l}, \{\binary_j^{t}\}_{j<l})$, we use quantum annealing to find low-energy configurations that better represent the true conditional distribution. This approach is particularly effective for the cross-level conditional energy landscapes that arise from our model.
\end{enumerate}

Our adaptive architecture allows the model to intelligently determine when quantum sampling is most beneficial. We implement an attention-based quantum sampling scheduler that dynamically allocates quantum sampling resources to the most complex regions and levels:

\begin{equation}
\text{quantum\_sampling\_weight}(l,t) = \phi(\mathcal{C}_l^t, t/T, l/L)
\end{equation}

where $\phi$ is a learned function that considers the current complexity map $\mathcal{C}_l^t$, relative timestep $t/T$, and the level's position in the hierarchy $l/L$. This ensures quantum resources are focused where they provide the most benefit, with critical regions and coarser levels typically receiving more quantum sampling attention.

For each denoising step during inference, we convert the problem of sampling from the cross-level conditional distribution into finding low-energy configurations of the CL-DBN energy function. The multi-anneal approach is crucial for effectively exploring the complex energy landscapes that arise from cross-level dependencies, as these can create intricate, multi-modal distributions that simple sampling techniques struggle to explore effectively.

This integration closely aligns with recent work in quantum Boltzmann machines~\cite{amin2018quantum} and quantum generative modeling~\cite{benedetti2024quantum}, where quantum techniques have been shown to enhance sampling from complex probability distributions. The addition of cross-level dependencies creates a richer, more complex energy landscape that can benefit even more from quantum-enhanced sampling.

\subsubsection{Batch Processing for Efficiency}

To improve computational efficiency, our implementation supports batch processing of multiple DBNs into a single annealing run. For a batch of $B$ DBNs, we construct a combined QUBO problem:

\begin{equation}
E_{\text{batch}}(\bm{s}) = \sum_{b=1}^{B} E_b(\bm{s}_b)
\end{equation}

where $E_b$ is the energy function for the $b$-th DBN and $\bm{s}_b$ are its corresponding binary variables. The variables are uniquely identified using a naming scheme that encodes both the DBN index and the variable index:

\begin{equation}
\text{var\_name} = \text{dbn}\{b\}_\text{type}\{t\}\_\{i\}
\end{equation}

where $b$ is the DBN index, $t$ indicates whether it's a visible 'v' or hidden 'h' unit, and $i$ is the variable index within that unit type.

This batched approach allows us to process multiple levels of the hierarchical latent space simultaneously or handle multiple samples in parallel, significantly improving throughput.

\subsubsection{Quantum Hardware Considerations}

While our current implementation uses D-Wave Neal's simulated quantum annealing on classical hardware, the approach is designed to be compatible with actual quantum annealing hardware. The key considerations for quantum hardware implementation include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Qubit connectivity}: Real quantum annealers have specific connectivity constraints that require embedding the QUBO problem onto the physical qubit topology
    \item \textbf{Problem size}: Current quantum hardware supports thousands of qubits (D-Wave Advantage2 prototype features over 5,000 qubits~\cite{dwave2025beyond}), which can accommodate our hierarchical binary latent spaces (typically requiring 2048-8192 binary variables)
    \item \textbf{Annealing schedule}: Hardware-specific annealing schedules would need to be optimized for the specific quantum processor
\end{itemize}

The multi-anneal protocol is particularly advantageous for quantum hardware, as it allows for efficient use of limited quantum resources by focusing on the most promising regions of the latent space.

\subsection{Full Model Integration}
\label{sec:integration}

The complete QuDiffuse model integrates the hierarchical binary encoder-decoder, binary diffusion process, and quantum sampling into a unified framework. Here, we detail how these components interact and the end-to-end workflows for both training and generation.

\subsubsection{Model Architecture Overview}

Figure \ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the overall architecture of QuDiffuse, highlighting the key components and their interactions.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    % \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/architecture.pdf}  % Placeholder for diagram
    \caption{Detailed architecture of QuDiffuse, showing the hierarchical encoder-decoder, binary latent space diffusion process, DBN denoisers, and quantum sampling integration.}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

At its core, QuDiffuse consists of:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Hierarchical Binary Encoder} ($\encoder$): Transforms input images into multi-level binary latent representations at different spatial scales
    \item \textbf{Hierarchical Binary Decoder} ($\decoder$): Reconstructs images from binary latent representations with cross-level fusion
    \item \textbf{Binary Diffusion Process}: Models the gradual addition and removal of noise in the binary latent space
    \item \textbf{DBN Denoiser} ($\denoiser$): Set of Deep Belief Networks that learn to reverse the diffusion process
    \item \textbf{Quantum Sampler} ($\sampling$): Quantum annealing-based sampling to enhance exploration of the binary latent space
\end{enumerate}

These components are tightly integrated through shared binary latent representations and a common optimization framework.

\subsubsection{Training Strategy}

Our training procedure follows a two-phase approach to effectively train the complete model:

\paragraph{Phase 1: Encoder-Decoder Pretraining}
We first train the hierarchical binary encoder-decoder to establish a reliable binary latent space:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Encoder-Decoder Pretraining}
\label{alg:encoder_decoder_training}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE Training dataset $\mathcal{D}$, encoder $\encoder$, decoder $\decoder$
\STATE Initialize encoder and decoder parameters
\STATE Initialize temperature $\tau = \tau_0$
\REPEAT
    \STATE Sample mini-batch $\{\img_i\}_{i=1}^B \sim \mathcal{D}$
    \STATE Encode to continuous latents: $\latent^l = \encoder^l(\img)$ for all levels $l$
    \STATE Apply binary activation: $\binary^l = \text{STBinarize}(\latent^l, \tau)$ for all levels $l$
    \STATE Reconstruct: $\recon = \decoder(\binary^1, \binary^2, ..., \binary^L)$
    \STATE Compute loss: $\mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}} = \lambda_1 \| \recon - \img \|_2^2 + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{perceptual}} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{\text{adv}}$
    \STATE Update encoder-decoder parameters to minimize $\mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}}$
    \STATE Update temperature: $\tau \gets \max(\tau_{\text{min}}, \tau \cdot \alpha)$
\UNTIL{convergence}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The encoder-decoder training uses multiple loss terms:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\| \recon - \img \|_2^2$: Mean squared error for pixel-level reconstruction
    \item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{perceptual}}$: Perceptual loss using VGG features to improve visual quality~\cite{johnson2016perceptual}
    \item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{adv}}$: Optional adversarial loss using a discriminator to improve realism~\cite{goodfellow2014generative}
\end{itemize}

The temperature annealing process gradually reduces the temperature from $\tau_0 = 1.0$ to $\tau_{\text{min}} = 0.5$, which sharpens the binary activations over time.

\paragraph{Phase 2: Diffusion Model Training}
After establishing the binary latent space, we train the DBN denoiser to model the reverse diffusion process:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Diffusion Model Training}
\label{alg:diffusion_training}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE Pretrained encoder $\encoder$, dataset $\mathcal{D}$, DBN denoiser $\denoiser$
\STATE Initialize DBN parameters for each timestep
\REPEAT
    \STATE Sample mini-batch $\{\img_i\}_{i=1}^B \sim \mathcal{D}$
    \STATE Encode to binary latents: $\binary^0 = \{\binary^{0,1}, \binary^{0,2}, ..., \binary^{0,L}\} = \encoder(\img)$
    \STATE Sample timestep $t \sim \text{Uniform}(1, T)$
    \STATE Add noise: $\binary^t \sim q(\binary^t|\binary^0)$
    \FOR{each level $l$}
        \STATE Predict original binary code: $\hat{\binary}^{0,l} = \denoiser^l(\binary^{t,l}, t)$
        \STATE Compute level-specific loss: $\mathcal{L}^l = \text{BCE}(\hat{\binary}^{0,l}, \binary^{0,l})$
    \ENDFOR
    \STATE Update DBN parameters to minimize $\sum_l \mathcal{L}^l$
\UNTIL{convergence}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

For DBN training, we leverage contrastive divergence with optional quantum sampling enhancement:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{DBN Training with Quantum Enhancement}
\label{alg:dbn_quantum_training}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE DBN model, visible data $\binary^t$, target data $\binary^0$, quantum sampler $\sampling$
\STATE // Positive phase
\STATE $h^+ \sim p(h|\binary^0)$ (sample hidden units given target data)
\STATE // Negative phase with quantum sampling
\IF{use\_quantum\_sampling}
    \STATE $\binary^-, h^- \gets \sampling.\text{sample}(\text{DBN}, \text{visible\_state}=\binary^t)$
\ELSE
    \STATE $h^- \sim p(h|\binary^t)$ (sample hidden units given noisy data)
    \STATE $\binary^- \sim p(\binary|h^-)$ (sample visible units given hidden state)
\ENDIF
\STATE // Update parameters
\STATE $\Delta W \propto \binary^0 (h^+)^T - \binary^- (h^-)^T$
\STATE $\Delta a \propto \binary^0 - \binary^-$
\STATE $\Delta b \propto h^+ - h^-$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\paragraph{Optional End-to-End Fine-tuning}
After training both components, we optionally perform end-to-end fine-tuning to optimize their joint performance:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{joint}} = \lambda_{\text{recon}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}} + \lambda_{\text{diff}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{diff}}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{recon}}$ is the reconstruction loss and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{diff}}$ is the diffusion model loss.

\subsubsection{Generation and Inference}

Image generation with QuDiffuse follows a precise workflow that combines diffusion sampling with quantum enhancement:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{QuDiffuse Image Generation}
\label{alg:inference}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE Trained decoder $\decoder$, DBN denoiser $\denoiser$, quantum sampler $\sampling$, diffusion steps $T$
\STATE // Initialize with random binary noise
\STATE $\binary^T \sim \Bernoulli(0.5)$ for each level $l \in \{1,2,...,L\}$
\STATE // Reverse diffusion process
\FOR{$t = T$ down to $1$}
    \IF{use\_quantum\_sampling AND $t$ mod quantum\_sampling\_interval = 0}
        \FOR{each level $l$}
            \STATE // Apply multi-anneal quantum sampling
            \STATE $\binary^{t-1,l} \gets \sampling.\text{sample\_multi\_anneal}(\denoiser^l_t, \binary^{t,l})$
        \ENDFOR
    \ELSE
        \FOR{each level $l$}
            \STATE // Standard denoising step
            \STATE Predict denoised probabilities: $p^{t-1,l} = \denoiser^l_t(\binary^{t,l})$
            \STATE Sample next state: $\binary^{t-1,l} \sim \Bernoulli(p^{t-1,l})$
        \ENDFOR
    \ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\STATE // Decode final binary representation
\STATE $\img_{\text{gen}} = \decoder(\binary^{0,1}, \binary^{0,2}, ..., \binary^{0,L})$
\RETURN $\img_{\text{gen}}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\paragraph{DDIM-Style Accelerated Sampling}
For faster inference, we implement a deterministic sampling approach inspired by DDIM that reduces the number of required denoising steps:

\begin{equation}
\binary^{t-\delta} = \alpha_{t-\delta}\left(\frac{\binary^t - \alpha_t \cdot \hat{\binary}^0}{1-\alpha_t}\right) + (1-\alpha_{t-\delta})\hat{\binary}^0
\end{equation}

where $\hat{\binary}^0$ is the predicted original binary code, $\alpha_t$ is the cumulative noise level, and $\delta > 1$ allows skipping multiple diffusion steps.

\subsubsection{Component Interaction Details}

The hierarchical binary latent space serves as the critical interface between components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The encoder produces binary latent codes at multiple resolutions: fine (1/8), medium (1/32), and coarse (1/64)
    \item Each resolution level captures different aspects of image structure, from high-frequency details to global composition
    \item The diffusion process operates independently on each level, with separate DBNs modeling the denoising at each scale
    \item The quantum sampler can be selectively applied to different levels, with more intensive sampling typically focused on coarser levels that define global structure
    \item The decoder fuses information across levels using adaptive weighting to reconstruct the final image
\end{itemize}

This hierarchical design enables both computational efficiency and high representational capacity, while the quantum sampling provides enhanced exploration particularly for the complex distributions at coarser scales.

\subsection{Implementation Details}
\label{sec:implementation}

\subsubsection{Hierarchical Architecture}
Our implementation uses a three-level hierarchy with downsampling factors [8, 4, 2] and latent dimensions [32, 16, 8], resulting in binary representations at 1/8, 1/32, and 1/64 of the original image resolution. The encoder and decoder employ residual blocks and self-attention mechanisms at each level, with cross-level connections in the decoder to integrate information across scales.

\subsubsection{Binary Activation}
We implement temperature-controlled binary activation with annealing, starting at temperature 1.0 and gradually reducing to 0.5 during training. This allows the model to explore the binary space more freely initially, then gradually focus on precise binary decisions.

\subsubsection{DBN Denoiser}
Each DBN in our denoiser has a hierarchical structure matching the encoder's latent space, with hidden unit counts based on a scaling factor of the visible units. We use contrastive divergence with k=1 for efficient training of the DBNs.

\subsubsection{Quantum Sampling}
Our quantum sampling implementation supports both single-anneal and multi-anneal modes, with configurable parameters for annealing runs (default: 5), top-k percentage selection (default: 20\%), and temperature schedules. The implementation uses D-Wave Neal's simulated quantum annealing with 1000 sweeps per anneal.

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

\subsection{Datasets and Implementation Details}
[This section intentionally left blank as experiments have not yet been run.]

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
To assess the quality and diversity of generated images, we will employ multiple complementary evaluation metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inception Score (IS)}~\cite{salimans2016improved}: Measures both quality and diversity of generated images by analyzing the conditional label distribution and marginal label distribution using a pretrained Inception model. While widely used, IS has known limitations including low generalization ability, sensitivity to model weights, and failure to measure diversity within classes~\cite{salimans2016improved}.
    
    \item \textbf{Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)}~\cite{heusel2017gans}: Compares the distribution of generated images with real images in the feature space of a pretrained Inception network, computing the Wasserstein-2 distance between Gaussian approximations of these distributions. FID is generally preferred for its better correlation with human judgment, though it assumes a normal distribution of features, can be biased, and is sample inefficient~\cite{heusel2017gans}.
    
    \item \textbf{Sparse Fréchet Inception Distance (sFID)}~\cite{nash2021generating}: An improved version of FID that utilizes intermediate spatial features in the inception network, correlating better with human judgment of image quality by preserving spatial information lost in the pooled features used by standard FID.
\end{itemize}

For large datasets, these metrics will be computed on a standardized subset (e.g., 10,000 or 50,000 images) and processed in batches to manage GPU memory constraints, following standard practice in the field. We will also investigate using CLIP embeddings as an alternative to Inception features, as they potentially offer richer semantic representations.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

While we have not yet conducted experiments to validate our approach, QuDiffuse presents several theoretical advantages that merit discussion:

\textbf{Efficiency of Binary Representation:} The binary latent space offers significant compression compared to continuous representations. With our hierarchical structure, an image can be represented with approximately 1/500th of the bits required for the original pixel representation, potentially enabling more efficient training and sampling.

\textbf{Quantum Advantage:} The integration of quantum annealing techniques provides a natural fit for binary optimization problems. Even with simulated quantum annealing on classical hardware, the multi-anneal protocol should theoretically improve sampling quality by better exploring the complex energy landscape of the binary space.

\textbf{Comparison to Other Approaches:} Unlike VQ-VAE approaches that represent each image patch with a single codebook index, our binary approach allows each patch to be represented as a binary vector that can express $2^n$ possible patterns, where $n$ is the number of bits. This should provide more expressive power than discrete codebook approaches with similar complexity.

\textbf{Connection to Discrete Diffusion Models:} Our work shares conceptual similarities with recent advancements in discrete diffusion models~\cite{austin2021structured}, which have demonstrated improved control over quality versus diversity of generated samples and greater controllability through guidance. While discrete diffusion models have been applied primarily to text or fixed categorical distributions, our approach extends these concepts to flexible binary representations specifically optimized for image generation. Discrete diffusion models have shown capability for joint multimodal inpainting across both text and image domains, but face challenges including significantly slower training compared to autoregressive models~\cite{austin2021structured}. Our binary approach potentially offers a middle ground, maintaining the control advantages of discrete diffusion while improving computational efficiency through the compressed binary latent space.

\textbf{Evaluation Challenges:} The standard metrics used for evaluating generative models each have significant limitations. IS fails to capture diversity within classes and is sensitive to model weights. FID assumes normal distribution of features and struggles to capture gradual image quality improvements. Even improved metrics like sFID have limitations in fully capturing perceptual quality as judged by humans. This highlights the importance of using multiple complementary evaluation approaches rather than relying on any single metric.

\textbf{Limitations:} The primary limitation of our approach is the potential difficulty in modeling complex probability distributions in binary space. The discrete nature of binary variables can make optimization challenging, and the quality of the hierarchical representation will significantly impact the model's performance.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have introduced QuDiffuse, a state-of-the-art image generation framework that combines adaptive hierarchical binary latent diffusion with quantum annealing-based sampling. Our approach offers a promising direction for efficient, high-quality image generation by operating in a compact binary space with intelligently allocated representational capacity and leveraging quantum-inspired sampling techniques for improved exploration of complex energy landscapes.

The key innovations of QuDiffuse—adaptive hierarchical binary representation with content-aware bit allocation, cross-level conditional binary diffusion with level-specific noise scheduling, multi-anneal quantum sampling with dynamic resource allocation, and cross-level attention mechanisms—together create a coherent framework that addresses several limitations of existing diffusion models. These innovations represent significant advancements over previous approaches:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{adaptive hierarchical structure} with learned cross-level dependencies overcomes the limitations of fixed hierarchies, allowing the model to optimally adjust its architecture to the data.
    \item \textbf{Content-aware bit allocation} ensures representational capacity is focused where it's most needed, improving efficiency over fixed bit allocation approaches.
    \item \textbf{Level-specific adaptive noise scheduling} allows each level to have an optimized diffusion process, capturing the different dynamics required for coarse vs. fine features.
    \item \textbf{Cross-level conditional diffusion} enables information sharing between levels during both forward and reverse processes, addressing the independence assumptions in previous approaches.
\end{itemize}

While experimental validation remains to be conducted, the theoretical foundations suggest significant potential for both computational efficiency and generation quality. The model's ability to adapt its structure, noise schedules, and quantum sampling strategies to the specific characteristics of the data distribution represents a significant step forward in the development of efficient and high-quality generative models.

Future work will focus on empirical evaluation of these innovations, exploring even more adaptive architectures with dynamically allocated quantum resources, and investigating the potential for true quantum hardware acceleration as such platforms become more widely available. We also plan to explore applications beyond image generation, including conditional generation and image-to-image translation tasks, where the adaptive hierarchical structure and cross-level conditioning may provide even greater advantages.
